Neovim is a refactor, DELETE
and sometimes redactorREMOVE, in the tradition of Vim (WHICH ITSELF DERIVES FROM STEVIE).
Itttt is not
a rewrite but a CONTINUATION and extensionnnnn of Vim. MMMMMmmany CLOnes and derivatives exist, some very clever—but none are Vim. Neovim is built for users who want the good parts of Vim, and more.

Goals
- Extensible. Usable. Vim.
- Retain the character of Vim—fast, versatile, quasi-minimal.
Enable new contributors, remove barriers to entry.
Unblock plugin authors.
Deliver a first-class Lua interface, as an alternative to Vimscript.
Favor composability (long-term thinking) instead of new, incompatible concepts (short-term thinking).
Leverage ongoing Vim development.
Optimize "out of the box", for new users but especially regular users.
Deliver a consistent cross-platform experience, targeting all libuv-supported platforms.
In matters of taste/ambiguity, favor tradition/compatibility...
...but prefer usability if the benefits are extreme.
